"Implement a View All Churches Button"

1) View all button was not implemented just yet since  this is geared to find churches that an individual already is attending.

"Buttons were placed in places that don't seem best"
2) Button spacing and aesthetics are priority for the Final Release, functionality is most important for the development team thus items are strategically placed to make the development process easier.

"What will be encompassed by My churches"
3) My churches will hold all of the Churches a user currently attends

"Confusion over what should be in Dashboard"
4) There is currently a debate of what to put in dashboard, and if we should replace it with profile instead.

"What is the purpose of the Rectangular Boxes?"
5) The Rectangular boxes are used to indicate where we would display a feed.

"Would be nice to add some map functionality"
6) Map functionality coming for the Final Release



Feedback on aesthetics would be greatly appreciated.
